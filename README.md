## Findings
----
Judging by the results obtained, I would use the RandomForestClassifier. The score (r2) of the model from the random forest classifier was much closer to 1 than that of the linear regression. In fact, the linear regression score was extremely low (less than 0.07)! This is probably because the data does not fit a linear plot very well with multiple x and y variables.
